# Alignment as Cognitive Infrastructure

AI alignment as cognitive and narrative infrastructure, documenting why token-level models systematically fail to preserve human constraints in irreversible social environments, and why alignment cannot be reduced to value optimization.

AI alignment is often framed as a problem of better objectives, better feedback, or better value representations. This repository starts from a harder claim: under certain social conditions, alignment does not merely fail—it fails systematically, regardless of optimization quality.

This work treats AI alignment as a problem of cognitive and narrative infrastructure, rather than preference fitting or reward tuning. In many real-world environments, human constraints are not stable values that can be learned or approximated. They are produced through irreversible social dynamics—including institutional decay, attention monopolization, long-term deprivation, and narrative lock-in. Once these dynamics are in place, models that operate on tokens are structurally misaligned with humans who live through accumulated consequences.

The central question explored here is therefore not which values a system should learn, but whether optimization-centric alignment can preserve human constraints at all when those constraints are path-dependent and non-reversible. Under such conditions, alignment failures are not accidental bugs or insufficient training—they are predictable outcomes of a mismatch between token-level reasoning and lived, irreversible experience.

This repository documents failure modes, breakdowns, and forced model transitions encountered while attempting region-based, rule-driven, and template-mediated alignment strategies. These failures motivate a shift toward infrastructure-level and dynamical formulations, where alignment is treated as long-horizon constraint preservation across tasks, time, and narrative contexts, rather than short-horizon behavioral fitting.

The intended audience includes researchers in AI alignment, AI safety, and human–AI interaction who are concerned with high-risk, non-ideal environments—where users are not fully rational, not well-resourced, and not institutionally protected by default. Materials are maintained as working drafts and research ledgers to enable external scrutiny and collaboration, especially on negative results and boundary conditions that are typically excluded from polished publications.

Critical feedback on failure modes, irreversibility assumptions, and constraint definitions—especially from deployment and safety perspectives—is explicitly welcomed.
